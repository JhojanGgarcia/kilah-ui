# Contributing to KilahUI

Thank you for considering contributing to KilahUI! Please follow the guidelines below to ensure a smooth process for everyone involved.

## Getting Started

### Fork the Repository

1. Fork the repository by clicking the "Fork" button at the top right of the repo page.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine using:

### Create a Branch

<ShikiServer
  code={`
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/[repo-name].git`}

lang={`bash`}
/>

Create a new branch from the dev branch. The branch name should follow the format add/component:

   <ShikiServer
  code={`
   git switch -c add/[component] dev`}

lang={`bash`}
/>

Replace component with the specific name of the components you are working on.

### Create a New Folder (If you are working on a full category)

1. Inside the `public/components` directory, create a new folder named after your specific component. Use lowercase letters and hyphens to join words if the component name has more than one word:

<ShikiServer
  code={`
   mkdir -p public/components/component-category`}

lang={`bash`}
/>

Replace component-category with the specific name of your component in lowercase and joined by hyphens if necessary.

### Add Components (If you are only adding compoennts start here)

1. Inside the folder you created in `public/components/component-category`, add an `component-name.html` file. This file will contain the HTML structure for your component.

2. Start writing the HTML structure for your component within the `component-name.html` file. (Only the compoennt itself)

### Update the index.json File
1. Navigate to the /public/components/[category]/index.json file for the category you wish to update.

2. Add a new element to the appropriate array or structure, following the existing schema for that category.

json

   <ShikiServer
  code={`
   { section: "cool-section" , // The section where this component belongs This will be a general way of group compoennts ex marketing, dashboard, general-ui
     title: "Cool Section",// The title of the section
     slug: "category", // The same name as the folder created in the previous step
     container: "Container Height", // The height of the playground container, e.g., "40rem"
     components: [
         title: "Subcomponent Title 1", // Title of the component
         fileName: "file-name-1", // The name of the file to be added
         tailwindConfig: {

                     danger: "#e5193e",
                     "danger-foreground": "#e9f1f9",
                     border: "#d1dce8",
                     input: "#d1dce8",
      },
