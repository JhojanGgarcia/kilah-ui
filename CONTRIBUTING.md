# Contributing to KilahUI

Thank you for considering contributing to KilahUI! Please follow the guidelines below to ensure a smooth process for everyone involved.

## Getting Started

### Fork the Repository

1. Fork the repository by clicking the "Fork" button at the top right of the repo page.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine using:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/[repo-name].git
    ```

### Create a Branch

Create a new branch from the `dev` branch. The branch name should follow the format `add/component`:

```bash
git switch -c add/[component] dev
```

Replace `component` with the specific name of the component you are working on.

### Create a New Folder (If you are working on a full category)

Inside the `public/components` directory, create a new folder named after your specific component. Use lowercase letters and hyphens to join words if the component name has more than one word:

```bash
mkdir -p public/components/component-category
```

Replace `component-category` with the specific name of your component in lowercase and joined by hyphens if necessary.

### Add Components (If you are only adding components, start here)

Inside the folder you created in `public/components/component-category`, add a `component-name.html` file. This file will contain the HTML structure for your component.

Start writing the HTML structure for your component within the `component-name.html` file. (Only the component itself)

### Update the `index.json` File

Navigate to the `/public/components/[category]/index.json` file for the category you wish to update.

Add a new element to the appropriate array or structure, following the existing schema for that category.

```json
{
  "section": "cool-section", // The section where this component belongs (e.g., marketing, dashboard, general-ui)
  "title": "Cool Section", // The title of the section
  "slug": "category", // The same name as the folder created in the previous step
  "container": "Container Height", // The height of the playground container, e.g., "40rem"
  "components": [
    {
      "title": "Subcomponent Title 1", // Title of the component
      "fileName": "file-name-1", // The name of the file to be added
      "tailwindConfig": {
        "darkMode": "class",
        "theme": {
          "extend": {
            "fontFamily": {
              "sans": ["Roboto Condensed"]
            },
            "colors": {
              "background": "#ffffff",
              "foreground": "#d82116",
              "card": "#ffffff",
              "card-foreground": "#d82116",
              "primary": "#846bce",
              "primary-foreground": "#e9f1f9",
              "secondary": "#e0e9f5",
              "secondary-foreground": "#2d3446",
              "accent": "#e0e9f5",
              "accent-foreground": "#2d3446",
              "danger": "#e5193e",
              "danger-foreground": "#e9f1f9",
              "border": "#d1dce8",
              "input": "#d1dce8"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
